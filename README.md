# JD-Mutual-Fund
This project is about predicting the mutual fund purchase behavior of customers who are active in JD.com, which is one of the largest online shopping platform in China. In this site, there are seven python files attached, inlcuding the python code for three models and process of features extraction.  

Part I - Model Proposed
1) Knowledge Transfer.py
Knowledge Transfer is out baseline model, which is OLS. We simply use all features extracted as input and take number of purchased mutual fund as target variables. This 

2) Model transfer.py
Model Transfer is inspired by transfer learning. This file contains the model transfer training structure and layers transfer process. 

3) Embedded Vector Transfer.py
Embedded vector transfer is about learning reduced product vector and reduced user vector. The file contains vector training process for products and users, as well as the pre-process parts. 

Part II - Extracted Features
For part II, there are 4 files that contains features extraction process. For simplicity, we only use 1 product as example. You may use the code for other productes' feature extraction.
